My name is Vignesh Eligeti, and I am currently in my fourth year pursuing a B-Tech degree from CMR College of Engineering and Technology. Over the past few years, I have worked as a freelance developer and completed several notable projects.

    SAMAM : A project focused on medical health assessment tools.
    Dynamic Length : A length predictor for e-commerce platforms like Amazon and Flipkart.

I am proficient in languages such as Java, Python, and SQL, and I have experience with various frameworks like Flask, Django, Spring Boot. My expertise lies in backend development and deep learning analysis.
